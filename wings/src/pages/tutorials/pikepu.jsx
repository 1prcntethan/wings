              The Pike Push-Up is the fundamental exercise for building strength
              toward vertical pushing movements. When performing this exercise
              on the floor, consider warming up your wrists, especially if
              you're a complete beginner.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width
                    apart, and hands facing forward or alternatively slightly
                    outward.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Walk your feet toward your hands, while bending at your
                    hips, until the angle between your legs and torso is around
                    90 degrees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It may be uncomfortable, but this is the starting position
                    for the pike pushup.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lower your head and body toward the ground, by bending your
                    elbows, and try to keep your legs straight.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once your head touches the ground, push back up with your
                    arms, straightening the elbows.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the exercise, it is recommended move slowly and
                    controlled coming down, but be explosive and fast when
                    coming up.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This exercise also requires some hamstring flexibility, but
                    it is okay to have some bend in the knees to make it easier.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The exercise difficulty can change, depending on if your
                    head goes down close to your hands, or far in front of your
                    hands.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To use this exercise effectively, perform these at a
                    difficulty where you can do 4-8 reps for strength, or 8-12
                    for hypertrophy/volume.
