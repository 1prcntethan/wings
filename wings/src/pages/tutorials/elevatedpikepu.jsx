              The Elevated Pike Push-Up is the progression exercise from the
              regular pike pushup, for building strength toward vertical pushing
              movements. When performing this exercise on the floor, consider
              warming up your wrists, or use low paralletes.

                <ul>
                  <li>Find an object to elevate your feet with.</li>
                  <li>
                    Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width
                    apart, and hands facing forward or alternatively slightly
                    outward.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Put your feet on the elevated object, your feet should be at
                    a higher elevation than your hands
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Walk your hands toward your feet, while bending at your
                    hips, until the angle between your legs and torso is around
                    90 degrees.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It may be uncomfortable, but this is the starting position
                    for the elevated pike pushup.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lower your head and body toward the ground, by bending your
                    elbows, and try to keep your legs straight.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once your head touches the ground, push back up with your
                    arms, straightening the elbows.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the exercise, it is recommended move slowly and
                    controlled coming down, but be explosive and fast when
                    coming up.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This exercise also requires some hamstring flexibility, but
                    it is okay to have some bend in the knees to make it easier.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The exercise difficulty can change, depending on if your
                    head goes down close to your hands, or far in front of your
                    hands.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The exercise becomes more difficult the higher your feet
                    are, since there is more bodyweight on your hands.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To use this exercise effectively, perform these at a
                    difficulty where you can do 4-8 reps for strength, or 8-12
                    for hypertrophy/volume.
                  </li>
                </ul>
