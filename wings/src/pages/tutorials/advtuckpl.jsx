              The Advanced Tuck Planche is the next progression after the Tuck
              Planche. The anterior deltoid is the main muscle used in this
              exercise. Protraction and depression should still be emphasized,
              as well lower back position.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Start in a squat position with your hands on the floor
                    shoulder-width apart, and hands turned at a 45 degree angle.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ensure your elbows are completely straightened, and that
                    your scapula is protracted and depressed.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Gradually lean your body forward by shifting your shoulders
                    ahead of your wrists, and feel the load on your feet
                    becoming lighter.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As you lift off, maintain straight arms and
                    protraction/depression, tucking your knees to your chest
                    while leaning forward.
                  </li>
                  <li>This is the tuck planche position.</li>
                  <li>
                    Slowly lower your knees until your thighs are pointing
                    directly at the floor. The leg position can also be
                    described as perpendicular to the floor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You should find yourself having to lean farther forward and
                    using more strength to hold this position compared to the
                    tuck planche.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As you lower your knees, think about keeping your feet as
                    close to your butt as possible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Keep your scapula protracted and depressed, and your
                    back/spine as neutral and flat as possible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To use this exercise effectively, perform holds at a
                    difficulty where you can hold them for at least 6-8 seconds,
                    counting each hold as a rep.
                  </li>
