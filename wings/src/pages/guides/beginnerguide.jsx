          First off, what is calisthenics and why is it worth investing your
          time? Calisthenics is a broad term for bodyweight exercises, and
          includes calisthenics skills, freestyle calisthenics, and weighted
          calisthenics. This site will mainly cover calisthenics skills, like
          the planche,{" "}

          Calisthenics is a great way to build muscle and help you get in shape.
          You’ll also practice balance, flexibility, and muscle coordination.
          Finally, on top of all this, you’ll learn impressive skills to show
          off to your friends!

          Calisthenics is a journey. If you have no prior athletic background,
          it will take multiple years to learn the most elite skills. Despite
          this, there are still skills you can learn in a couple months, and if
          you train right, you can shorten the time it takes to learn skills.

          extremely advanced skills and take multiple years to achieve. You can

          <strong> height</strong> and <strong>starting weight</strong> also
          play a role. Shorter people have an advantage in lever skills like the
          front lever, while taller people are disadvantaged. Additionally, with
          skills being based on bodyweight, skills are more challenging for
          heavier people and easier for lighter people. That being said, almost

          You could read this entire site. You can watch every YouTube tutorial
          on the planet. But you won’t get anywhere by skipping every other day,
          or not eating right. You have to show up.{" "}
          <strong>Consistently</strong>. In fact, you don’t even have to train
          super seriously or go crazy with the science based training. Simply by
          showing up and working out everyday, you will make progress. Look at
          calisthenics as a fun activity, which it is! Set a routine and a block
          of time dedicated to working out. Remember, there are no shortcuts to
          success.

        <div className="guide-text">
          Bonus tip: Every seasoned calisthenics creator and athlete will say
          the same thing. <strong>Film yourself</strong>. Consistently record
          yourself doing your exercises and skills. It doesn’t matter if you’re
          a beginner, or if you only have tuck planche. Record it all! Having
          recordings of yourself to look at will be a huge help when identifying
          issues with your form, and it’ll help you fix it. Also, having an
          extensive log of your exercises will allow you to visibly see progress
          as you get stronger. Trust me, anyone who didn’t record their journey
          deeply regrets it.

          This is actually a common mistake many beginners make; they want to

          progression holds for productive amounts of time or volume. Instead,
          building muscle and conditioning your body first allows you to hold

          Additionally, you want to lean toward the hypertrophy side of training
          when first starting out. This is to gain a baseline of muscle, which

          starts with muscle mass. As you become more experienced, expect to

          Overtraining happens when you push yourself <strong>too far</strong>,
          whether it be too much volume or intensity. For calisthenics, we focus
          mostly on strength, which is the 4-8 rep range, give or take. This
          means that doing 20 reps is considered endurance, and won’t contribute
          much significant progress to building strength. Additionally,
          overtraining
          <strong> volume</strong> is extremely likely to make you sore, which
          can sometimes affect your next session and prevent you from training
          at 100%. Overtraining <strong>intensity</strong> means you’re doing
          too many exercises to their max, and overall, you can’t accumulate
          enough volume. For calisthenics, aim to be doing your workouts at
          80-90%, so close to failure but not completely.

          Form is a very important part of calisthenics. Not following form can

          with good form before you move on. There are exceptions though. While
          focusing on form is good, there is a place for bad form, like when
          you’re first learning a progression or exercise. You can’t focus on
          form all the time, and sometimes it's okay to trade form for longer

          For carbohydrates/fats, aim to eat as <strong>healthy</strong> as
          possible. This means sticking to complex carbohydrates (brown rice,

          fish). Having a healthy body and healthy diet will benefit you in more

          “Calisthenics doesn’t build muscle” <br />
          If you’re trying to build muscle with calisthenics, don’t worry.
          <strong> Calisthenics does build muscle</strong>. While the main focus
          of calisthenics isn’t to build muscles, any increase in strength will
          always come with an increase in muscle; it’s just how the body works.
          If you really wanted, you could also start weighted calisthenics,
          which promotes more straightforward muscle growth.

        <div className="guide-text">
          “You need weights for real strength” <br />
          In calisthenics, you will probably only be pushing your body weight.
          While that’s true, that doesn’t mean you won’t build the strength to
          push more than that. Calisthenics mainly builds{" "}
          <strong>relative strength</strong>, relative to your body weight.
          However, by using leverages, we can build muscle that pushes an
          equivalent of much more weight. Also, with weighted calisthenics, we
          can increase our body weight and make exercises even more challenging.

          body needs time to <strong>rest and recover</strong>, in order to heal

          And that’s it! With all this information, you now know the tip of the
          iceberg that calisthenics has to offer. From here, you should check
          out the fundamental guides at your leisure, and start your
          calisthenics training sessions with the plan above. Take a look at the

          </Link>{" "}
          page to familiarize yourself with calisthenics lingo and determine
          your skill level. Also, choose your <strong>target skills</strong>,
          the skills you want to be doing 2 or 3 years down the road. Make sure
          to choose 1 primary push skill and 1 primary pull skill. Any more
          might split your focus and training too much to make any meaningful
          progress. There are also calisthenics communities online you can join
          and follow, like on Discord or Instagram. Finally, make sure to stay
          patient, listen to your body, and <strong>enjoy the process</strong>{" "}
          the whole way.
