          The handstand is a balance focused skill that involves supporting your
          entire body weight on your hands. On this site, it’s rated C, for high
          beginner, and takes around <strong>2-3 months</strong> to learn, given
          daily training. The handstand is a super iconic skill which transfers
          to many other advanced skills, and most importantly, unlocks a
          prerequisite for the

          <strong> balance, mobility, and body coordination.</strong>

          To warm up for the handstand, and prepare yourself for the upside down
          position, firstly warm up the wrists. You can use wrist circles, wrist
          stretches, or wrist push-ups. Then, warm up your shoulder; stretch
          upward, and think about your shoulders being elevated, with your bicep
          touching your ear. Finally, practice a hollow body hold and think
          about engaging the core and glutes.

          The handstand is a balanced focused skill, and in reality doesn’t take
          much strength. However, for beginners, the weight of your body is
          usually unfamiliar, and you will need a base strength of being upside
          down without losing stamina or getting sore.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          The handstand also tests your <strong>shoulder mobility.</strong> In
          the handstand, you have to be able to raise your arms straight up,
          almost touching your bicep/shoulder to your ears. Without this
          shoulder mobility, you won’t be able to stack your body properly and
          hold the signature handstand line.

          Wrist extension is extremely important in the handstand as well. You
          need to be able to pull your wrists back to{" "}
          <strong>just around 90 degrees</strong>, and a bit more if you want to
          be able to hold yourself up. If your wrist extension is poor, consider
          doing wrist stretching exercises to improve the mobility of your
          wrist.

        <div className="guide-heading">learning to fall</div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          One of the biggest limiting factors for people learning the handstand
          is the <strong>fear of falling</strong>, which is completely
          understandable. As a beginner, the idea of being completely upside
          down relying only on your hands is extremely daunting. But without
          overcoming this barrier, you will probably never be able to learn the
          handstand.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          Obviously, the fear is not from falling backward where you can catch
          yourself with your legs; it's from falling forward. The basic steps
          for bailing from a handstand are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you feel yourself falling forward, move one hand in front of
              you by a couple inches.
            </li>
            <li>Twist your body in that direction as you fall.</li>
            <li>And finally, catch yourself, with either one or two legs.</li>
          </ul>
          This fall seems almost too simple, and it is; the main challenge here
          is getting used to the fall. Try to keep one hand on the ground, the
          one that didn’t move. Also, choose a side to fall on, so you don’t
          have to pick which direction to twist in every time you’re mid fall.
          Another way to think of the fall is like the end of the cartwheel.

          Check out this video! It's not only a good resource for a visual
          representation of the fall; it also outlines how to learn the
          handstand in general.

        <div className="guide-text">
          To practice falling, start with using a wall, in a chest-to-wall
          handstand. It doesn’t have to be a completely straight handstand, you
          can be at a 60 degree angle if you wanted to. Choose a progression
          that feels right for you. From this chest-to-wall handstand, simply
          walk a hand forward, and drop the legs on the side where your hand
          moved forward. As you get better, you can make your chest-to-wall
          handstand more and more vertical, and soon, you’ll have the skill to
          bail out of a real handstand. Finally, test that! Kick up into a
          freestanding handstand with the intention to fall forward, and try to
          bail. Only do this when you’re truly ready though; it's easy to injure
          your wrist or hand, or hit something if you fall wrongly.

        <div className="guide-text">
          When practicing your handstand off and on the wall, aim to include
          these following form cues.
          <ul>
            <li>Straight arms and legs</li>
            <li>Stacked body (wrists, shoulders, hips, knees, feet)</li>
            <li>Elevation (push into the floor, feel tall)</li>
            <li>Look between your hands</li>
            <li>Remember to breathe even when upside down</li>
            <li>Keep your whole body engaged (arms, abs, glutes)</li>
            <li>Pointed toes (for aesthetics)</li>
            <li>Grip the floor (works for some people, try it out!)</li>
          </ul>
          Record yourself doing handstands to understand what your form
          currently looks like, and know if you need to fix anything.

        <div className="guide-text">
          The first thing to know about training the handstand is that because
          it doesn’t require much muscular strength, you can train it pretty
          frequently, without getting fatigued or having to exert much effort.
          This is why you can aim to train the handstand{" "}
          <strong>everyday</strong>, if you want maximum progress.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          To begin training, find a wall you can kick up to, and do wall
          handstands with your <strong>back</strong> to the wall. At first,
          don’t worry too much about balancing, the most important part at this
          stage is to get used to the feeling of being upside down, and getting
          used to your bodyweight and the wrist position of the handstand. Also,
          focus on keeping your body completely straight and in line, and all
          the other form cues of the handstand. You may experience “headaches”
          during or after handstand training. For the most part, they are
          normal, and your body will eventually get used to being upside down.
          However, don’t push through <strong>intense pain</strong>, and stop if
          the <strong>headaches persist unreasonably</strong>.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          Once you’re used to the general handstand movement, you can start
          working on balance. In order to balance, you have to keep your center
          of mass directly above your hands. To do this, you will be using your
          <strong> fingers</strong> and the <strong>heel</strong> of your hands.
          Similar to standing on two feet, your fingers should press into the
          ground when you feel yourself fall forward, and you should feel the
          heel of your palm press into the ground when you feel yourself falling
          back. However, if you stack your weight straight onto the heel of your
          palm, you’d have no control if you fell backward, which is why it's
          better to be <strong>leaning a bit forward</strong> and constantly
          pushing back with your fingers.
        </div>
        <img
          src="wristLeanAnn.png"
          alt="wrist lean"
          className="square-guide-image"
        />
        <div className="guide-caption">
          There should be a slight lean forward in the handstand.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          To practice balancing, start your normal back to wall handstand, but
          with your hands just less than a foot away from the wall. Kick up and
          rest your feet on the wall. Then, try to push into the ground with
          your fingers, and balance so that your feet come off the wall. You can
          also practice balancing the opposite way, with your chest to the wall,
          but you have to know how to bail. Starting in a chest-to-wall
          handstand, with your fingers less than half a foot away from the wall,
          press the heel of your palm into the ground and try to find that sweet
          spot where you’re using your fingers to stop yourself from falling
          forward.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          Once you’ve learned to balance, you can start attempting freestanding
          handstands off the wall. Start with your hands on the ground, shoulder
          width apart, bending down with your feet staggered. Your strong foot
          will be the <strong>kick off</strong> foot, while your weak foot will
          be the foot <strong>kicking up</strong>. Push off the ground with your
          strong foot, while kicking up with your weak, to enter the handstand
          position. Before you kick off, make sure your{" "}
          <strong>shoulders are above your wrists</strong>, and imagine trying
          to stack your hips on your shoulders.
        </div>
        <div className="guide-text">
          After a while, you will feel more and more accommodated to the
          handstand movement. It can take a week to multiple months to learn the
          handstand, depending on training amount, experience, and fitness.
          However, with enough practice and dedication, the handstand is a
          realistic and easily achievable skill for anyone.

          The handstand is an extremely flexible exercise, and once you learn
          the balance, feel free to experiment with it. You can make shapes with
          your legs, arch your back, balance in a pike position, and much more.
          From here, you can also start learning the handstand push-up, another
          staple calisthenics skill. If you really want a challenge, you can try
          learning the one arm handstand. Be warned though, the OAHS truly is a
          whole different beast.
